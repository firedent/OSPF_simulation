# COMP9331_Assignment

For this assignment, your task is to implement the link state routing protocol. Your program will be running at all routers in the specified network. At each router, the input to your program is a set of directly attached routers (i.e. neighbours) and the costs of these links. Each router will broadcast link-state packets to all other routers in the network. Your routing program at each router should report the least-cost path and the associated cost to all other routers in the network. Your program should be able to deal with failed routers.
